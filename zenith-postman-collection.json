Annual compliance is mandated by the payment card schemes and banks.\n\n## What is PCI DSS?\n\nPCI DSS is a global standard, helping to protect cardholder data and tackle the growing threat of security breaches. It sets the operational and technical requirements for organizations handling card payments, and for software developers and manufacturers of payment applications and devices.\n\nZenith Payment's entire infrastructure is fully compliant with PCI DSS - we are certified at Level 1, which is the highest level of compliance. We are independently audited annually for compliance by qualified security assessors.\n\n## What this means for you?\n\nWhilst Zenith Payments is a PCI DSS compliant organisation, if your organization does accept card payments then it must also be fully compliant. Non-compliance with PCI DSS could make you responsible for any losses through fraud, and you may also face considerable fines from the card schemes and banks.\n\nThere are four levels of compliance, dependant on how many transactions are processed by your organisation in a year. Find out how your organisation can reach compliance at the [PCI Security Standards Council Website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security)","event":[{"listen":"prerequest","script":{"id":"ecbc2269-12ab-43a3-b98d-5a7edc21b95f","type":"text/javascript","exec":[""]}},{"listen":"test","script":{"id":"5a1db881-e216-43bc-997a-5f29377479eb","type":"text/javascript","exec":[""]}}],"uid":"10633263-d7f2d193-b909-41a8-853f-87f912e57511"},{"name":"jQuery Payment Plugin","item":[{"name":"Overview","item":[],"id":"c8b948ad-23b8-42f4-94a1-557ac6b500af","description":"## Use Cases\n\nThere are a variety of use cases in which the JQuery plugin can be used in your integration, the below examples are some of the most common use cases where the JQuery plugin works well.\n\n### Shopping Cart\n\nThe JQuery plugin can be used in a shopping cart type of system, through which a customer can add items to their shopping cart and upon checkout of their cart they are able to use the JQuery plugin to make a payment for their purchase. The plugin works great here as it takes very minimal space on the site and expands when the user clicks on the button.\n\n### One-Off Payment\n\nThe JQuery plugin can be used as a one-off payment solution, whereby a customer is able to easily complete a one-off payment to a merchant using the plugin. The customers payment is able to be traced by using a payment reference in a simple, easy way of your choice.\n\n### Card Tokenization\n\nThe JQuery plugin is able to tokenize customer cards and bank accounts, by creating a unique token for the payment method instead of storing the actual card/bank account details in the system, the token is generated and stored securely to uniquely identify the payment method the customer has tokenized. Customers can feel more secure and protected knowing that their card and bank details are kept safe and not stored in the system.","uid":"10633263-c8b948ad-23b8-42f4-94a1-557ac6b500af"},{"name":"JQuery V3 to V5 Migration Guide","item":[],"id":"f17f3b87-297a-457f-8711-cbd894cd5061","description":"# ZenPay Migration Guide: Version 3 to Version 5\n\nThis guide explains how to migrate your ZenPay integration from v3 to v5, focusing on key changes in hashing, required parameters, and payload structure.\n\nIf you are on an earlier version (v1 or v2), please reach out to our integrations team for assistance by emailing [integrations@zenithpayments.com.au](https://mailto:integrations@zenithpayments.com.au).\n\n> 💡 Please note this example uses travelpay as the program domain.

Customers then enter the PayID (which is an email address) and a PayID description to make a payment to the merchant.\n\nPayID is a great alternative to EFT as merchants gain extra security by not having to provide their BSB and Bank Account details.\n\n#### Benefits to Merchants\n\n- Quick and easy new way to pay.\n- Instant approval with no subsequent failures.\n- Secure – no need to give out bank details (like with EFT) which prevent frauds and unauthorised debits\n- Cleared Funds in your bank account by lunchtime the next banking day.\n- Always the correct reference regardless of what the customer enters \\*with ‘Customer’ PayID Type\\*\n- Fast – easy to use, real time payment processing.\n- Easy – Customer pays via their existing bank APP / website.\n- Visible – payments immediately appear in the payment history.\n- Always On – operates 24/7 365.\n    \n\n#### Benefits to Customers\n\n- Easy – pay through your existing Bank App/website\n- No cost to you\n- Merchant knows you have paid immediately\n- Merchant gets your transaction funds quickly\n- Secure, modern, payment method\n    \n\nZenith Payments supports three different types of PayID levels. More details about each of the different PayID types can be found below.\n\n**Summary of PayID Types**\n\n|  | **Program PayID** | **Customer PayID** | **Merchant PayID** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **PayID Type**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>**Example:**  <br> | Every merchant in the program has the same PayID email address.  <br>  <br>pay@travelpay.com.au  <br> | Every customer in the program has a unique PayID email address.  <br>  <br>john_12345678@travelpay.com.au | Every merchant in the program has a different PayID email address.  <br>  <br>@travelpay.com.au  <br> |\n| **Suitable For** | Most merchants wanting to quickly implement PayID. | Ongoing payments when customers may be inclined to enter the wrong reference when they pay. | One-off transactions / invoice payments  <br> |\n| **Customer profile and CML Required?  <br>(Customer-Merchant Link)**  <br> | Yes | Yes | No |\n| **PayID Description the customer needs to enter** | PayID Description the customer needs to enter | The customer can enter whatever reference they like. | Reference that was provided by the merchant on the invoice, etc.  <br> |\n| **Customer Reference used in reports (Reconciliation, etc.)** | The Customer Reference that is stored in the Customer’s profile for that merchant.  <br> | The Customer Reference that is stored in the Customer’s profile for that merchant. | 'Description/Message’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site when paying |\n| **Additional Reference  <br>used in reports**  <br> | ‘Description/Message’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site when paying | ‘Description/Message’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site when paying | ‘Reference’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site when paying |\n| **Advantages  <br>** | Easy to implement.  <br>  <br> | The merchant always receives the stored Customer Reference even if the customer enters the wrong reference when paying. | Easy to use – customer pays just like they would with EFT.  <br>  <br>Easy to implement – merchant just adds their PayID to their invoice template. |\n\n## Merchant Level\n\nMerchant Level PayID provides the merchant with a unique PayID email address that they can put on their invoices or send to customers so that their customers can use to make a payment to that merchant.\n\n#### Use Cases\n\n- One-off transactions\n- Ad hoc Invoice payments\n    \n\n#### How it Works?\n\n- PayID email address specifies the merchant in ZenPay. (i.e. (merchantcode)@b2bpay.com.au)\n- Does not require a customer profile to work (No CML is required)\n- The PayID reference is generated upon creation and is provided by the merchant\n- Customer enters in the correct reference as specified by the merchant to assist the merchant with reconciliation)\n    \n\n#### How does a Merchant create a PayID Email Address?\n\nFor this type of integration, PayID is created by the Zenith Support staff for the requested merchant/s.\n\n#### How does a customer make a PayID payment?\n\nThe user makes a payment from their banking app via their mobile device or PC. User enters the PayID email, in return the banking app will display the PayID name for the merchant.\n\nThe user enters description and message (reference) which are captured and attached to payment. \"CustomerReference\" and \"AdditionalReference\" parameters are used for capturing this information.\n\nMore information coming soon...\n\n## Customer Level\n\nComing Soon...\n\n## Program Level\n\nComing Soon...","uid":"10633263-a459e0b5-a584-40d5-abfa-d31b4cfefa2c"}],"id":"a1938ee6-6634-40e3-ae15-eee93ea21f64","uid":"10633263-a1938ee6-6634-40e3-ae15-eee93ea21f64"},{"name":"API Overview","item":[{"name":"Error Codes","item":[],"id":"ab28e229-e801-429d-8785-266db5871de7","description":"ZenPay uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.\n\nIn general \"status codes\" in the `2XX` range indicate success.\n\nWhereas, \"status codes\" in the `4XX` range indicate a client-side error, which means that there was a failure in the information provided (e.g., a missing parameter, unauthorized access etc.).\n\n\"Status codes\" in the `5XX` range indicate an error with Zenith Payment's internal servers (Which happens very rarely).\n\nIf the response code is not `2XX`, it means the operation failed somehow and you may  \nneed to take action accordingly.

These are event-based: whenever a transaction belonging to the merchant changes status (across any channel or payment method), Zenith fires a webhook. They are dispatched on a scheduler/timer that evaluates transaction states and posts updates.\n    \n- **Callbacks(jQuery Only)** – Transaction-specific notifications only available in the **jQuery Payment Plugin**. If the integrator includes a `callbackUrl` in the plugin payload, Zenith posts the transaction result to that URL after processing.\n    \n\n**Key differences**\n\n| Aspect | Webhooks | Callbacks (jQuery plugin only) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Scope | Merchant-wide (all transactions) | Single transaction (initiated by plugin) |\n| Trigger | Any payment status change | Immediately when upstream processing completes (response received) |\n| Configuration | Set up once by Zenith on merchant acct | Passed as `callbackUrl` in plugin payload |\n| Delivery | Event-based, timer-driven POST | Asynchronous POST after processing |\n| Availability | All channels / methods | jQuery plugin only, not APIs |\n\n> Use **Webhooks** for backend reconciliation and settlement tracking.  \nUse **Callbacks** if you need immediate, per-transaction acknowledgement when using the plugin. \n  \n\n# Webhooks\n\nWebhooks are merchant-wide, event-based notifications configured at the merchant account level by Zenith.\n\nOnce a webhook endpoint is registered, Zenith will POST JSON payloads whenever the status of any transaction for that merchant changes. This includes all payment methods.\n\n**Requirements and Characteristics**\n\n- **Merchant-wide** – Any transaction initiated under the merchant account is eligible.\n    \n- **Event-based** – Fired when transaction status changes (e.g. from Pending to Successful).\n    \n- **Timer-driven** – A scheduled job evaluates transactions and dispatches events.\n    \n- **Channel-agnostic** – All payment methods trigger the same webhook mechanism.\n    \n- **Stable HTTPS POST endpoint** – Must be reachable from Zenith's servers.\n    \n\n### Webhook Payload Fields\n\n| Field | Type | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Version` | number | Payload version number. |\n| `Event` | string | Event type (e.g. `New`, `Update`). |\n| `PayloadType` | string | Type of payload delivered (e.g. `Payment, Customer`). |\n| `PaymentReference` | string | Unique payment reference assigned by Zenith. |\n| `CustomerName` | string | null |\n| `CustomerReference` | string | Reference provided by the merchant. |\n| `PaymentStatus` | number | Numeric status code. |\n| `PaymentStatusDisplay` | string | Human-readable payment status. |\n| `BaseAmount` | number | Base amount before fees. |\n| `FundsToMerchant` | number | Net amount payable to the merchant. |\n| `CustomerFee` | number | Fee charged to the customer. |\n| `MerchantFee` | number | Fee charged to the merchant. |\n| `PaymentAmount` | number | Total amount of the transaction. |\n| `AccountOrCardNo` | string | Masked account or card number. |\n| `PaymentMethod` | number | Numeric code for the payment method. |\n| `PaymentMethodDisplay` | string | Human-readable payment method. |\n| `PaymentCardType` | number | Numeric code for the card type. |\n| `PaymentCardTypeDisplay` | string | Human-readable card type. |\n| `SubCardType` | string | null |\n| `SubtCardTypeDisplay` | string | null (Field name is misspelled, this is not an error in documentation) |\n| `ProcessingDateTime` | string | UTC ISO-8601 datetime (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`). |\n| `SettlementDate` | string | UTC ISO-8601 date (`yyyy-MM-dd`). |\n| `ProcessorReference` | string | Reference from the processor/gateway. |\n| `IsPaymentSettledToMerchant` | boolean | Indicates if the payment has been settled. |\n| `MerchantUniquePaymentId` | string | null |\n| `MerchantCode` | string | Merchant identifier. |\n| `AdditionalReference` | string | null |\n| `PaymentSource` | number | Numeric source identifier. |\n| `PaymentSourceDispaly` | string | Field name is misspelled, this is not an error in documentation |\n| `IsPaymentRecalled` | boolean | Indicates if the payment has been recalled. |\n| `IsPaymentRefunded` | boolean | Indicates if the payment has been refunded. |\n\n## **Webhook Payload Example**\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"Version\": 1,\n  \"Event\": \"New\",\n  \"PayloadType\": \"Payment\",\n  \"Payload\": {\n    \"PaymentReference\": \"210768\",\n    \"CustomerName\": null,\n    \"CustomerReference\": \"1\",\n    \"PaymentStatus\": 3,\n    \"PaymentStatusDisplay\": \"Successful\",\n    \"BaseAmount\": 155.08,\n    \"FundsToMerchant\": 155.08,\n    \"CustomerFee\": 4,\n    \"MerchantFee\": 0,\n    \"PaymentAmount\": 159.08,\n    \"AccountOrCardNo\": \"411111XXXXXX1111\",\n    \"PaymentMethod\": 0,\n    \"PaymentMethodDisplay\": \"Credit / Debit Card\",\n    \"PaymentCardType\": 1,\n    \"PaymentCardTypeDisplay\": \"Visa - International Cards\",\n    \"SubCardType\": null,\n    \"SubtCardTypeDisplay\": null,\n    \"ProcessingDateTime\": \"2025-08-27T22:08:14\",\n    \"SettlementDate\": \"2025-08-28\",\n    \"ProcessorReference\": \"2a41cff0e84ee15f8b42\",\n    \"IsPaymentSettledToMerchant\": false,\n    \"MerchantUniquePaymentId\": null,\n    \"MerchantCode\": \"1337\",\n    \"AdditionalReference\": null,\n    \"PaymentSource\": 39,\n    \"PaymentSourceDispaly\": \"Api Tokenised Payment\",\n    \"IsPaymentRecalled\": false,\n    \"IsPaymentRefunded\": false\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n# Callbacks (jQuery Plugin Only)\n\nCallbacks are only supported in the **jQuery Payment Plugin** and are not available in the REST API.\n\nWhen a `callbackUrl` parameter is included in the plugin payload, Zenith will POST the transaction result to that URL after the payment is processed.\n\n**Requirements and Characteristics**\n\n- **Transaction-specific** – The callback applies only to the transaction in which the `callbackUrl` was supplied.\n    \n- **Asynchronous** – Delivery occurs in the background after Zenith finishes processing, not as a browser redirect.\n    \n- **Integrator-controlled** – The integrator decides the callback destination via the `callbackUrl` option.\n    \n- **Not merchant-wide** – Callbacks do not notify on other transactions; for that, use webhooks.\n    \n- **HTTPS POST endpoint** – Must expose a secure endpoint that is reachable from Zenith.\n    \n- **Asynchronous handling** – Must accept POSTs that may arrive seconds after the browser flow completes.\n    \n- **Validation** – Should validate the `validationCode` (SHA3-512) for integrity before trusting the payload.\n    \n\n## Callback Payload Fields\n\n| Field | Type | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `paymentReference` | string | Unique payment reference assigned by Zenith. |\n| `customerName` | string | Name of the customer. |\n| `customerReference` | string | Reference provided by the merchant. |\n| `paymentStatus` | number | Numeric status code of the payment. |\n| `paymentStatusString` | string | Human-readable payment status (e.g. “Successful”). |\n| `baseAmount` | number | Base transaction amount before fees. |\n| `fundsToMerchant` | number | Net amount payable to the merchant. |\n| `accountOrCardNo` | string | Masked account or card number. |\n| `paymentAccount` | string | Payment account type (e.g. `Card`, `Bank`). |\n| `processingDate` | string | UTC ISO-8601 datetime (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss[.fff]`). |\n| `settlementDate` | string | UTC ISO-8601 datetime (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`). |\n| `processorReference` | string | Reference from the processor/gateway. |\n| `isPaymentSettledToMerchant` | boolean | Indicates if the payment has been settled to the merchant. |\n| `failureCode` | string | Failure code if unsuccessful, otherwise empty. |\n| `failureReason` | string | Failure reason if unsuccessful, otherwise empty. |\n| `paymentCard` | string | Card brand (e.g. MasterCard, Visa). |\n| `merchantUniquePaymentId` | string | Unique ID supplied by the merchant for the payment. |\n| `merchantCode` | string | Merchant identifier code. |\n| `transactionSource` | number | Numeric identifier for the source channel. |\n| `transactionSourceString` | string | Human-readable source channel (e.g. plugin or API). |\n| `customerFee` | number | Fee charged to the customer. |\n| `processedAmount` | number | Total processed amount including fees. |\n| `cardCategory` | string | Category of the card (e.g. Domestic, International). |\n| `cardInformationSaved` | boolean | Indicates whether the card information was stored for tokenisation. |\n| `validationCode` | string | SHA3-512 hash for payload integrity validation. |\n\n## **Callback Payload Example**\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"paymentReference\": \"95408\",\n    \"customerName\": \"Leah Adria\",\n    \"customerReference\": \"a12b1926-811f-411c-b10a-1b330cc50d3b\",\n    \"paymentStatus\": 3,\n    \"paymentStatusString\": \"Successful\",\n    \"baseAmount\": 635.72,\n    \"fundsToMerchant\": 635.72,\n    \"accountOrCardNo\": \"555555XXXXXX4444\",\n    \"paymentAccount\": \"Card\",\n    \"processingDate\": \"2025-08-27T21:48:59.447\",\n    \"settlementDate\": \"2025-08-29T00:00:00\",\n    \"processorReference\": \"ddb3a3436cbc7d77c241\",\n    \"isPaymentSettledToMerchant\": false,\n    \"failureCode\": \"\",\n    \"failureReason\": \"\",\n    \"paymentCard\": \"MasterCard\",\n    \"merchantUniquePaymentId\": \"35917c6c-ee6b-4e52-866b-bea51841e796\",\n    \"merchantCode\": \"1337\",\n    \"transactionSource\": 36,\n    \"transactionSourceString\": \"Public_Customer_OnlineOneOffPayment\",\n    \"customerFee\": 63.57,\n    \"processedAmount\": 699.29,\n    \"cardCategory\": \"International Cards\",\n    \"cardInformationSaved\": false\n  },\n  \"validationCode\": \"1dbe5ddcc72b8207e839da42308d0596cbbb72e5bf7074520ec885e3c615bb519848fce4a0c073a9a7e6544854338cab9c0c87bc8c82c54bb3706a91c21a7410\"\n}\n\n ```","uid":"10633263-3ff00b67-8eb0-4033-a2a7-f324fad290aa"},{"name":"Merchant APIs","item":[{"name":"Authentication","item":[],"id":"e03fd63a-4a9f-46c8-8dc4-809fbc4df037","description":"## Basic Authentication\n\n[Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.
