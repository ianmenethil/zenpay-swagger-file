Demo\n    \n5. Production Sign Off\n    \n\nTo get started, talk to us about your particular business and technology requirements. Our team of Payment Specialists will ensure you have access to the right solutions that meet your needs.\n\nThey will also assist you with your application for a sandbox account and API credentials.\n\n# Contact Us\n\n- Please email us at [integrations@zenithpayments.com.au](https://integrations@zenithpayments.com.au)\n    \n\n# Getting your API credentials\n\nYour Sandbox API credentials for Merchant APIs will consist of a username, a password and a API-Key.  \nFor Customer APIs, the bearer token is self-generated from the customer portal.\n\nWe are able to provide you with you're very own Sandbox API credentials after our initial requirements meeting with our payment specialists.\n\nYou are able to use your sandbox details with the \"Run in Postman\" link above. Remember to set your desired language in the examples.\n\n# Sandbox URLs\n\nThe below is a list of the different Sandbox environments where you are able to develop, test and experiment using the different ZenPay APIs.\n\n| **Sandbox Environment** | **Link** |\n| --- | --- |\n| TravelPay | [https://api.sandbox.travelpay.com.au](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au) |\n| TravelPay B2B | [https://api](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au)[.sandbox](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au)[.travelpay.com.au](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au) |\n| School Easy Pay | [https://api](https://apiuat.schooleasypay.com.au)[.sandbox](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au)[.schooleasypay.com.au](https://apiuat.schooleasypay.com.au) |\n| Childcare Easy Pay | [https://api](https://apiuat.childcareeasypay.com.au)[.sandbox](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au)[.childcareeasypay.com.au](https://apiuat.childcareeasypay.com.au) |\n| Thoroughbred Payments | [https://api](https://apiuat.thoroughbredpayments.com.au)[.sandbox](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au)[.thoroughbredpayments.com.au](https://apiuat.thoroughbredpayments.com.au) |\n| Rental Rewards | [https://api](https://apiuat.rentalrewards.com.au)[.sandbox](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au)[.rentalrewards.com.au](https://apiuat.rentalrewards.com.au) |\n| B2BPay | [https://api](https://apiuat.b2bpay.com.au)[.sandbox](https://apiuat.travelpay.com.au)[.b2bpay.com.au](https://apiuat.b2bpay.com.au) |\n\n# Production / Live URLs\n\nOnce you have completed the process of development and testing, we will run a quick sign off meeting with you. Allowing you to demonstrate your software and the integrations between the two systems, and allowing us to understand the integrations that you have developed.\n\nOnce both parties have signed off we can then proceed to provide live credentials and URLs for production.\n\nPlease reach out to your Account Manager to schedule the integration sign off."

      "name": "PCI Compliance",
      "description": "Every organization that handles card payments must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Annual compliance is mandated by the payment card schemes and banks.\n\n## What is PCI DSS?\n\nPCI DSS is a global standard, helping to protect cardholder data and tackle the growing threat of security breaches. It sets the operational and technical requirements for organizations handling card payments, and for software developers and manufacturers of payment applications and devices.\n\nZenith Payment's entire infrastructure is fully compliant with PCI DSS - we are certified at Level 1, which is the highest level of compliance. We are independently audited annually for compliance by qualified security assessors.\n\n## What this means for you?\n\nWhilst Zenith Payments is a PCI DSS compliant organisation, if your organization does accept card payments then it must also be fully compliant. Non-compliance with PCI DSS could make you responsible for any losses through fraud, and you may also face considerable fines from the card schemes and banks.\n\nThere are four levels of compliance, dependant on how many transactions are processed by your organisation in a year. Find out how your organisation can reach compliance at the [PCI Security Standards Council Website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security)"

      "description": "The ZenPay JQuery plugin allows you to easily make payments or tokenize cards/bank accounts utilising a user-friendly, easy to use UI that is built within the browser. The plugin can be used as an iframe form or can displayed on the webpage in a place of your choosing by embedding the iframe to your webpage.\n\n**jQuery Version 5 is now available in both our Sandbox and Production environments:**\n\n> **❗Please note that after 30 September 2025, plugins on V4 and below will no longer be able to process payments or tokenise cards.** \n  \n\n- If you are currently using jQuery plugin V4, then the main change is to upgrade your hashing from SHA512 to SHA3-512 and update your URL from v4 to v5.  \n    Additionally, there are new optional input parameters available to enable you to customise the display of ‘Customer Name’, ‘Customer Reference’, and ‘Payment Amount’ labels.\n    \n- If you are on V3 please see the migration guide.\n    \n- If you are currently using jQuery plugin V1, V2, we recommend scheduling a session in with our integrations team to talk through the specific upgrade requirements.\n    \n\n**Apple Pay**\n\nThe jQuery Plugin solution now supports Apple Pay. If you are interested in adding this feature as a payment method, you need to pass the Apple Pay parameter “allowApplePayOneOffPayment” and set as “True”. You then need to engage with the Zenith Integrations team to verify your domain.\n\n**Google Pay**\n\nThe jQuery Plugin solution now supports Google Pay. If you are interested in adding this feature as a payment method, you need to pass the Google Pay parameter “allowGooglePayOneOffPayment” and set as “True”."

      "description": "## Use Cases\n\nThere are a variety of use cases in which the JQuery plugin can be used in your integration, the below examples are some of the most common use cases where the JQuery plugin works well.\n\n### Shopping Cart\n\nThe JQuery plugin can be used in a shopping cart type of system, through which a customer can add items to their shopping cart and upon checkout of their cart they are able to use the JQuery plugin to make a payment for their purchase. The plugin works great here as it takes very minimal space on the site and expands when the user clicks on the button.\n\n### One-Off Payment\n\nThe JQuery plugin can be used as a one-off payment solution, whereby a customer is able to easily complete a one-off payment to a merchant using the plugin. The customers payment is able to be traced by using a payment reference in a simple, easy way of your choice.\n\n### Card Tokenization\n\nThe JQuery plugin is able to tokenize customer cards and bank accounts, by creating a unique token for the payment method instead of storing the actual card/bank account details in the system, the token is generated and stored securely to uniquely identify the payment method the customer has tokenized. Customers can feel more secure and protected knowing that their card and bank details are kept safe and not stored in the system."

Example Migration: Before and After\n\n> **❗Please note that these examples are for demonstration purposes only. In production, always use a secure backend to generate fingerprints and handle sensitive data.** \n  \n> 🛡️ **Important**:  \nAlways use the exact same values for all fingerprint parameters (apiKey, merchantCode, mode, paymentAmount, merchantUniquePaymentId, and especially **timestamp**) in both fingerprint payload and the ZenPay plugin payload.  \nEven a 1-second difference in timestamp will cause a fingerprint mismatch and throw an error during initialization (e.g., error **E08**). \n  \n\n## v1 & v2:\n\nIf you are on older versions of the plugin, please review the example below, or reach out to our integration team with any questions by emailing [integrations@zenithpayments.com.au ](https://mailto:integrations@zenithpayments.com.au) for assistance.\n\n## v3 Example:\n\n``` javascript\n// Create payload for fingerprint\nconst apiKey = \"PUBLIC_API_KEY\";  // Provided by Zenith Payments\nconst userName = \"username\";      // Provided by Zenith Payments\nconst password = \"password\";      // Provided by Zenith Payments\nconst mode = 0;                   // Mode 0: Static Payment - Mode 1: Tokenization - Mode 2: Dynamic Payment - Mode 3: Pre-auth\nconst paymentAmount = 250.00;     // Tip: always use two decimal digits (e.g., 250.00)\nconst merchantUniquePaymentId = crypto.randomUUID(); // Could be anything as long as unique\n// Generate fingerprint using SHA1\nconst fpPayload = `${apiKey}|${userName}|${password}|${mode}|${paymentAmount * 100}|${merchantUniquePaymentId}`;\nconst fingerprint = CryptoJS.SHA1(fpPayload).toString(); \n// Create payload for ZenPay plugin\nconst zpPayload = {\n  url: \"https://payuat.travelpay.com.au/online/v3\",\n  apiKey,                         // Must match value used in fingerprint generation\n  fingerprint,                    // SHA1 fingerprint\n  redirectUrl: \"https://payuat.travelpay.com.au/demo?result\",\n  mode,                           // Must match value used in fingerprint generation\n  customerName: \"Jane Doe\",\n  customerReference: \"INV-991\",\n  merchantUniquePaymentId,        // Must match value used in fingerprint generation\n    paymentAmount // Must match value used in fingerprint generation, but as dollars (e.g., if hash used 1234 then paymentAmount is 12.34)\n};\n// Initialize ZenPay plugin\nconst payment = $.zpPayment({ ...zpPayload });\nconst result = payment.open();    // Use open() for v3\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n## v5 Example:\n\n``` javascript\n// Create payload for fingerprint\nconst apiKey = \"PUBLIC_API_KEY\";            // Provided by Zenith Payments\nconst userName = \"username\";                // Provided by Zenith Payments\nconst password = \"password\";                // Provided by Zenith Payments\nconst merchantCode = \"TPDEMOMERCH\";         // Provided by Zenith Payments - Required in v5\nconst mode = 0;                             // Mode 0: Static Payment - Mode 1: Tokenization - Mode 2: Dynamic Payment - Mode 3: Pre-auth\nconst paymentAmount = 250.00;               // Tip: always use two decimal digits (e.g., 250.00)\nconst merchantUniquePaymentId = crypto.randomUUID(); // Could be anything as long as unique\nconst timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19); // Format: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'\n// Generate fingerprint using SHA3-512\nconst fpPayload = `${apiKey}|${userName}|${password}|${mode}|${paymentAmount * 100}|${merchantUniquePaymentId}|${timestamp}`;\nconst fingerprint = sha3_512(fpPayload); \n// Create payload for ZenPay plugin\nconst zpPayload = {\n  url: \"https://pay.sandbox.travelpay.com.au/online/v5\",\n  apiKey,                         // Must match value used in fingerprint generation\n  fingerprint,                    // SHA3-512 fingerprint\n  merchantCode,                   // Provided by Zenith Payments - Required in v5\n  redirectUrl: \"https://pay.sandbox.travelpay.com.au/demo?result\",\n  mode,                           // Must match value used in fingerprint generation\n  customerName: \"Jane Doe\",\n  customerReference: \"INV-991\",\n  merchantUniquePaymentId,        // Must match value used in fingerprint generation\n  paymentAmount,                  // Must match value used in fingerprint generation, but as dollars (e.g., if hash used 1234 then paymentAmount is 12.34)\n  timestamp,                      // Must match value used in fingerprint generation\n  customerEmail: \"jane.doe@example.com\"\n};\n// Initialize ZenPay plugin\nconst payment = $.zpPayment({ ...zpPayload });\nconst result = payment.init();    // Use init() for v5\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n## 6\\. One-Time IDs\n\n- **`merchantUniquePaymentId`** must be unique for every payment request.\n    \n- Once used, it cannot be reused, regardless of payment status.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 7\\. Summary Table: Key Migration Changes\n\n| Change | v3 | v5 (required) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hash Algorithm | SHA1 | SHA3-512 |\n| Fingerprint Fields | No timestamp | Includes `timestamp` |\n| merchantCode | Not required | Required |\n| customerEmail | Not required | Required (since v4) |\n| timestamp | Not required | Required |\n\n---\n\n## 8\\. Best Practices\n\n- **Never** generate fingerprints or handle backend secrets client-side.\n    \n- Always generate the fingerprint and unique payment ID on your backend.\n    \n- Validate all required fields before initializing the plugin."

To set it up, the Zenith Payments team can guide you through the integration process consisting of a few simple steps.\n\n## Integration Process\n\nTo accept Apple Pay payments using the jQuery plugin, you need to follow a few simple steps:\n\n1. The integrator or merchant needs to contact the Zenith Payments Integrations Team with the specific domain URL that they would like to integrate with Apple Pay (e.g., [www.b2bpay.com.au](http://www.b2bpay.com.au))\n    \n2. Zenith Payments will register the provided domain with Apple Pay. (This is a crucial step to ensure the security and proper functioning of the integration).\n    \n3. After the domain is registered, Zenith Payments will provide a file for each domain/merchant. This file is essential for the integration process.\n    \n4. The integrator/merchant must place the provided file in a specific path on their website, ensuring it is publicly accessible. This step is essential for Apple Pay to verify the integration.\n    \n5. Once the file is in place, reach out to the team at Zenith Payments and the team will verify the integration with Apple Pay.\n    \n6.

      "description": "PayID is a faster payment method for bank account payments.\n\nCustomers can make PayID payments from within their bank account application or online banking portal by using a unique PayID identifier. Customers then enter the PayID (which is an email address) and a PayID description to make a payment to the merchant.\n\nPayID is a great alternative to EFT as merchants gain extra security by not having to provide their BSB and Bank Account details.\n\n#### Benefits to Merchants\n\n- Quick and easy new way to pay.\n- Instant approval with no subsequent failures.\n- Secure – no need to give out bank details (like with EFT) which prevent frauds and unauthorised debits\n- Cleared Funds in your bank account by lunchtime the next banking day.\n- Always the correct reference regardless of what the customer enters \\*with ‘Customer’ PayID Type\\*\n- Fast – easy to use, real time payment processing.\n- Easy – Customer pays via their existing bank APP / website.\n- Visible – payments immediately appear in the payment history.\n- Always On – operates 24/7 365.\n    \n\n#### Benefits to Customers\n\n- Easy – pay through your existing Bank App/website\n- No cost to you\n- Merchant knows you have paid immediately\n- Merchant gets your transaction funds quickly\n- Secure, modern, payment method\n    \n\nZenith Payments supports three different types of PayID levels. More details about each of the different PayID types can be found below.\n\n**Summary of PayID Types**\n\n|  | **Program PayID** | **Customer PayID** | **Merchant PayID** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **PayID Type**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>**Example:**  <br> | Every merchant in the program has the same PayID email address.  <br>  <br>pay@travelpay.com.au  <br> | Every customer in the program has a unique PayID email address.  <br>  <br>john_12345678@travelpay.com.au | Every merchant in the program has a different PayID email address.  <br>  <br>@travelpay.com.au  <br> |\n| **Suitable For** | Most merchants wanting to quickly implement PayID. | Ongoing payments when customers may be inclined to enter the wrong reference when they pay. | One-off transactions / invoice payments  <br> |\n| **Customer profile and CML Required?  <br>(Customer-Merchant Link)**  <br> | Yes | Yes | No |\n| **PayID Description the customer needs to enter** | PayID Description the customer needs to enter | The customer can enter whatever reference they like. | Reference that was provided by the merchant on the invoice, etc.  <br> |\n| **Customer Reference used in reports (Reconciliation, etc.)** | The Customer Reference that is stored in the Customer’s profile for that merchant.  <br> | The Customer Reference that is stored in the Customer’s profile for that merchant. | 'Description/Message’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site when paying |\n| **Additional Reference  <br>used in reports**  <br> | ‘Description/Message’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site when paying | ‘Description/Message’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site when paying | ‘Reference’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site when paying |\n| **Advantages  <br>** | Easy to implement.  <br>  <br> | The merchant always receives the stored Customer Reference even if the customer enters the wrong reference when paying. | Easy to use – customer pays just like they would with EFT.  <br>  <br>Easy to implement – merchant just adds their PayID to their invoice template. |\n\n## Merchant Level\n\nMerchant Level PayID provides the merchant with a unique PayID email address that they can put on their invoices or send to customers so that their customers can use to make a payment to that merchant.\n\n#### Use Cases\n\n- One-off transactions\n- Ad hoc Invoice payments\n    \n\n#### How it Works?\n\n- PayID email address specifies the merchant in ZenPay. (i.e. (merchantcode)@b2bpay.com.au)\n- Does not require a customer profile to work (No CML is required)\n- The PayID reference is generated upon creation and is provided by the merchant\n- Customer enters in the correct reference as specified by the merchant to assist the merchant with reconciliation)\n    \n\n#### How does a Merchant create a PayID Email Address?\n\nFor this type of integration, PayID is created by the Zenith Support staff for the requested merchant/s.\n\n#### How does a customer make a PayID payment?\n\nThe user makes a payment from their banking app via their mobile device or PC. User enters the PayID email, in return the banking app will display the PayID name for the merchant.\n\nThe user enters description and message (reference) which are captured and attached to payment. \"CustomerReference\" and \"AdditionalReference\" parameters are used for capturing this information.\n\nMore information coming soon...\n\n## Customer Level\n\nComing Soon...\n\n## Program Level\n\nComing Soon..."

      "name": "Webhooks and Callbacks",
      "description": "Zenith Payments provides outbound notifications so that integrators can be informed of payment results.\n\nThere are two technical delivery mechanisms:\n\n- **Webhooks** – Merchant-wide notifications configured once by Zenith. These are event-based: whenever a transaction belonging to the merchant changes status (across any channel or payment method), Zenith fires a webhook. They are dispatched on a scheduler/timer that evaluates transaction states and posts updates.\n    \n- **Callbacks(jQuery Only)** – Transaction-specific notifications only available in the **jQuery Payment Plugin**. If the integrator includes a `callbackUrl` in the plugin payload, Zenith posts the transaction result to that URL after processing.\n    \n\n**Key differences**\n\n| Aspect | Webhooks | Callbacks (jQuery plugin only) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Scope | Merchant-wide (all transactions) | Single transaction (initiated by plugin) |\n| Trigger | Any payment status change | Immediately when upstream processing completes (response received) |\n| Configuration | Set up once by Zenith on merchant acct | Passed as `callbackUrl` in plugin payload |\n| Delivery | Event-based, timer-driven POST | Asynchronous POST after processing |\n| Availability | All channels / methods | jQuery plugin only, not APIs |\n\n> Use **Webhooks** for backend reconciliation and settlement tracking.  \nUse **Callbacks** if you need immediate, per-transaction acknowledgement when using the plugin. \n  \n\n# Webhooks\n\nWebhooks are merchant-wide, event-based notifications configured at the merchant account level by Zenith.\n\nOnce a webhook endpoint is registered, Zenith will POST JSON payloads whenever the status of any transaction for that merchant changes. This includes all payment methods.\n\n**Requirements and Characteristics**\n\n- **Merchant-wide** – Any transaction initiated under the merchant account is eligible.\n    \n- **Event-based** – Fired when transaction status changes (e.g. from Pending to Successful).\n    \n- **Timer-driven** – A scheduled job evaluates transactions and dispatches events.\n    \n- **Channel-agnostic** – All payment methods trigger the same webhook mechanism.\n    \n- **Stable HTTPS POST endpoint** – Must be reachable from Zenith's servers.\n    \n\n### Webhook Payload Fields\n\n| Field | Type | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Version` | number | Payload version number. |\n| `Event` | string | Event type (e.g. `New`, `Update`). |\n| `PayloadType` | string | Type of payload delivered (e.g. `Payment, Customer`). |\n| `PaymentReference` | string | Unique payment reference assigned by Zenith. |\n| `CustomerName` | string | null |\n| `CustomerReference` | string | Reference provided by the merchant. |\n| `PaymentStatus` | number | Numeric status code. |\n| `PaymentStatusDisplay` | string | Human-readable payment status. |\n| `BaseAmount` | number | Base amount before fees. |\n| `FundsToMerchant` | number | Net amount payable to the merchant. |\n| `CustomerFee` | number | Fee charged to the customer. |\n| `MerchantFee` | number | Fee charged to the merchant. |\n| `PaymentAmount` | number | Total amount of the transaction. |\n| `AccountOrCardNo` | string | Masked account or card number. |\n| `PaymentMethod` | number | Numeric code for the payment method. |\n| `PaymentMethodDisplay` | string | Human-readable payment method. |\n| `PaymentCardType` | number | Numeric code for the card type. |\n| `PaymentCardTypeDisplay` | string | Human-readable card type. |\n| `SubCardType` | string | null |\n| `SubtCardTypeDisplay` | string | null (Field name is misspelled, this is not an error in documentation) |\n| `ProcessingDateTime` | string | UTC ISO-8601 datetime (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`). |\n| `SettlementDate` | string | UTC ISO-8601 date (`yyyy-MM-dd`). |\n| `ProcessorReference` | string | Reference from the processor/gateway. |\n| `IsPaymentSettledToMerchant` | boolean | Indicates if the payment has been settled. |\n| `MerchantUniquePaymentId` | string | null |\n| `MerchantCode` | string | Merchant identifier. |\n| `AdditionalReference` | string | null |\n| `PaymentSource` | number | Numeric source identifier. |\n| `PaymentSourceDispaly` | string | Field name is misspelled, this is not an error in documentation |\n| `IsPaymentRecalled` | boolean | Indicates if the payment has been recalled. |\n| `IsPaymentRefunded` | boolean | Indicates if the payment has been refunded. |\n\n## **Webhook Payload Example**\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"Version\": 1,\n  \"Event\": \"New\",\n  \"PayloadType\": \"Payment\",\n  \"Payload\": {\n    \"PaymentReference\": \"210768\",\n    \"CustomerName\": null,\n    \"CustomerReference\": \"1\",\n    \"PaymentStatus\": 3,\n    \"PaymentStatusDisplay\": \"Successful\",\n    \"BaseAmount\": 155.08,\n    \"FundsToMerchant\": 155.08,\n    \"CustomerFee\": 4,\n    \"MerchantFee\": 0,\n    \"PaymentAmount\": 159.08,\n    \"AccountOrCardNo\": \"411111XXXXXX1111\",\n    \"PaymentMethod\": 0,\n    \"PaymentMethodDisplay\": \"Credit / Debit Card\",\n    \"PaymentCardType\": 1,\n    \"PaymentCardTypeDisplay\": \"Visa - International Cards\",\n    \"SubCardType\": null,\n    \"SubtCardTypeDisplay\": null,\n    \"ProcessingDateTime\": \"2025-08-27T22:08:14\",\n    \"SettlementDate\": \"2025-08-28\",\n    \"ProcessorReference\": \"2a41cff0e84ee15f8b42\",\n    \"IsPaymentSettledToMerchant\": false,\n    \"MerchantUniquePaymentId\": null,\n    \"MerchantCode\": \"1337\",\n    \"AdditionalReference\": null,\n    \"PaymentSource\": 39,\n    \"PaymentSourceDispaly\": \"Api Tokenised Payment\",\n    \"IsPaymentRecalled\": false,\n    \"IsPaymentRefunded\": false\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n# Callbacks (jQuery Plugin Only)\n\nCallbacks are only supported in the **jQuery Payment Plugin** and are not available in the REST API.\n\nWhen a `callbackUrl` parameter is included in the plugin payload, Zenith will POST the transaction result to that URL after the payment is processed.\n\n**Requirements and Characteristics**\n\n- **Transaction-specific** – The callback applies only to the transaction in which the `callbackUrl` was supplied.\n    \n- **Asynchronous** – Delivery occurs in the background after Zenith finishes processing, not as a browser redirect.\n    \n- **Integrator-controlled** – The integrator decides the callback destination via the `callbackUrl` option.\n    \n- **Not merchant-wide** – Callbacks do not notify on other transactions; for that, use webhooks.\n    \n- **HTTPS POST endpoint** – Must expose a secure endpoint that is reachable from Zenith.\n    \n- **Asynchronous handling** – Must accept POSTs that may arrive seconds after the browser flow completes.\n    \n- **Validation** – Should validate the `validationCode` (SHA3-512) for integrity before trusting the payload.\n    \n\n## Callback Payload Fields\n\n| Field | Type | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `paymentReference` | string | Unique payment reference assigned by Zenith. |\n| `customerName` | string | Name of the customer. |\n| `customerReference` | string | Reference provided by the merchant. |\n| `paymentStatus` | number | Numeric status code of the payment. |\n| `paymentStatusString` | string | Human-readable payment status (e.g. “Successful”). |\n| `baseAmount` | number | Base transaction amount before fees. |\n| `fundsToMerchant` | number | Net amount payable to the merchant. |\n| `accountOrCardNo` | string | Masked account or card number. |\n| `paymentAccount` | string | Payment account type (e.g. `Card`, `Bank`). |\n| `processingDate` | string | UTC ISO-8601 datetime (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss[.fff]`). |\n| `settlementDate` | string | UTC ISO-8601 datetime (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`). |\n| `processorReference` | string | Reference from the processor/gateway. |\n| `isPaymentSettledToMerchant` | boolean | Indicates if the payment has been settled to the merchant. |\n| `failureCode` | string | Failure code if unsuccessful, otherwise empty. |\n| `failureReason` | string | Failure reason if unsuccessful, otherwise empty. |\n| `paymentCard` | string | Card brand (e.g. MasterCard, Visa). |\n| `merchantUniquePaymentId` | string | Unique ID supplied by the merchant for the payment. |\n| `merchantCode` | string | Merchant identifier code. |\n| `transactionSource` | number | Numeric identifier for the source channel. |\n| `transactionSourceString` | string | Human-readable source channel (e.g. plugin or API). |\n| `customerFee` | number | Fee charged to the customer. |\n| `processedAmount` | number | Total processed amount including fees. |\n| `cardCategory` | string | Category of the card (e.g. Domestic, International). |\n| `cardInformationSaved` | boolean | Indicates whether the card information was stored for tokenisation. |\n| `validationCode` | string | SHA3-512 hash for payload integrity validation. |\n\n## **Callback Payload Example**\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"paymentReference\": \"95408\",\n    \"customerName\": \"Leah Adria\",\n    \"customerReference\": \"a12b1926-811f-411c-b10a-1b330cc50d3b\",\n    \"paymentStatus\": 3,\n    \"paymentStatusString\": \"Successful\",\n    \"baseAmount\": 635.72,\n    \"fundsToMerchant\": 635.72,\n    \"accountOrCardNo\": \"555555XXXXXX4444\",\n    \"paymentAccount\": \"Card\",\n    \"processingDate\": \"2025-08-27T21:48:59.447\",\n    \"settlementDate\": \"2025-08-29T00:00:00\",\n    \"processorReference\": \"ddb3a3436cbc7d77c241\",\n    \"isPaymentSettledToMerchant\": false,\n    \"failureCode\": \"\",\n    \"failureReason\": \"\",\n    \"paymentCard\": \"MasterCard\",\n    \"merchantUniquePaymentId\": \"35917c6c-ee6b-4e52-866b-bea51841e796\",\n    \"merchantCode\": \"1337\",\n    \"transactionSource\": 36,\n    \"transactionSourceString\": \"Public_Customer_OnlineOneOffPayment\",\n    \"customerFee\": 63.57,\n    \"processedAmount\": 699.29,\n    \"cardCategory\": \"International Cards\",\n    \"cardInformationSaved\": false\n  },\n  \"validationCode\": \"1dbe5ddcc72b8207e839da42308d0596cbbb72e5bf7074520ec885e3c615bb519848fce4a0c073a9a7e6544854338cab9c0c87bc8c82c54bb3706a91c21a7410\"\n}\n\n ```"

To enhance security and reduce the risks associated with directly managing card data, we strongly recommend using our **Payment Plugin jQuery** for secure card tokenization and payment processing.\n\n**Please note:** This endpoint is restricted and can only be accessed once it has been enabled by Zenith Payments.
