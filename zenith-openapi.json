      # Contact Us


      - Please email us at
      [integrations@zenithpayments.com.au](https://integrations@zenithpayments.com.au)
          

      # Getting your API credentials


      Your Sandbox API credentials for Merchant APIs will consist of a username,
      a password and a API-Key.  

      For Customer APIs, the bearer token is self-generated from the customer

      # Production / Live URLs


      Once you have completed the process of development and testing, we will
      run a quick sign off meeting with you. Allowing you to demonstrate your
      software and the integrations between the two systems, and allowing us to
      understand the integrations that you have developed.


      Once both parties have signed off we can then proceed to provide live
      credentials and URLs for production.


      Please reach out to your Account Manager to schedule the integration sign
      off.
  - name: PCI Compliance
    description: >-
      Every organization that handles card payments must comply with the Payment
      Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Annual compliance is
      mandated by the payment card schemes and banks.


      ## What is PCI DSS?


      PCI DSS is a global standard, helping to protect cardholder data and
      tackle the growing threat of security breaches. It sets the operational
      and technical requirements for organizations handling card payments, and
      for software developers and manufacturers of payment applications and
      devices.


      Zenith Payment's entire infrastructure is fully compliant with PCI DSS -
      we are certified at Level 1, which is the highest level of compliance. We
      are independently audited annually for compliance by qualified security
      assessors.


      ## What this means for you?


      Whilst Zenith Payments is a PCI DSS compliant organisation, if your
      organization does accept card payments then it must also be fully
      compliant. Non-compliance with PCI DSS could make you responsible for any
      losses through fraud, and you may also face considerable fines from the
      card schemes and banks.


      There are four levels of compliance, dependant on how many transactions
      are processed by your organisation in a year. Find out how your
      organisation can reach compliance at the [PCI Security Standards Council
      Website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security)
  - name: jQuery Payment Plugin
    description: >-
      The ZenPay JQuery plugin allows you to easily make payments or tokenize
      cards/bank accounts utilising a user-friendly, easy to use UI that is
      built within the browser. The plugin can be used as an iframe form or can
      displayed on the webpage in a place of your choosing by embedding the
      iframe to your webpage.


      **jQuery Version 5 is now available in both our Sandbox and Production
      environments:**


      > **❗Please note that after 30 September 2025, plugins on V4 and below
      will no longer be able to process payments or tokenise cards.** 
        

      - If you are currently using jQuery plugin V4, then the main change is to
      upgrade your hashing from SHA512 to SHA3-512 and update your URL from v4
      to v5.  
          Additionally, there are new optional input parameters available to enable you to customise the display of ‘Customer Name’, ‘Customer Reference’, and ‘Payment Amount’ labels.
          
      - If you are on V3 please see the migration guide.
          
      - If you are currently using jQuery plugin V1, V2, we recommend scheduling
      a session in with our integrations team to talk through the specific
      upgrade requirements.
          

      **Apple Pay**


      The jQuery Plugin solution now supports Apple Pay. If you are interested
      in adding this feature as a payment method, you need to pass the Apple Pay
      parameter “allowApplePayOneOffPayment” and set as “True”. You then need to
      engage with the Zenith Integrations team to verify your domain.


      **Google Pay**


      The jQuery Plugin solution now supports Google Pay. If you are interested
      in adding this feature as a payment method, you need to pass the Google
      Pay parameter “allowGooglePayOneOffPayment” and set as “True”.
  - name: jQuery Payment Plugin > Overview
    description: >-
      ## Use Cases


      There are a variety of use cases in which the JQuery plugin can be used in
      your integration, the below examples are some of the most common use cases
      where the JQuery plugin works well.


      ### Shopping Cart


      The JQuery plugin can be used in a shopping cart type of system, through
      which a customer can add items to their shopping cart and upon checkout of
      their cart they are able to use the JQuery plugin to make a payment for
      their purchase. The plugin works great here as it takes very minimal space
      on the site and expands when the user clicks on the button.


      ### One-Off Payment


      The JQuery plugin can be used as a one-off payment solution, whereby a
      customer is able to easily complete a one-off payment to a merchant using
      the plugin. The customers payment is able to be traced by using a payment
      reference in a simple, easy way of your choice.


      ### Card Tokenization


      The JQuery plugin is able to tokenize customer cards and bank accounts, by
      creating a unique token for the payment method instead of storing the
      actual card/bank account details in the system, the token is generated and
      stored securely to uniquely identify the payment method the customer has
      tokenized. Customers can feel more secure and protected knowing that their
      card and bank details are kept safe and not stored in the system.

      ## Official Demo, Documentation, and Full Configuration Reference


      - **Official v5 Demo & Docs:**
      [https://pay.sandbox.travelpay.com.au/demo/](https://pay.sandbox.travelpay.com.au/demo/)
          

      This page contains:


      - Error codes table
          
      - Input and output parameter tables
          
      - All available configuration options and usage notes
          
      - Live demo and code sample
          

      ---


      ## 2\. Endpoint URL Update


      - **v3:**
          

      ``` plaintext

      url: "<https://payuat.travelpay.com.au/online/v3>"

       ```

      - **v5:**
          

      ``` plaintext

      url: "<https://pay.sandbox.travelpay.com.au/online/v5>"

       ```

      Update your integration to use the v5 endpoint.


      Production URL remains the same, changing to /v5 (travel pay used as an
      example below)


      ``` plaintext

      url: "<https://pay.travelpay.com.au/online/v5>"

       ```

      ---


      ## 3\. Fingerprint Hash Algorithm


      - **v3:** Used SHA1 for fingerprint generation.
          

      ``` javascript

      // v3 (SHA1)

      const hash =
      SHA1(apiKey|userName|password|mode|paymentAmount|merchantUniquePaymentId)

       ```

      **v5:** Uses SHA3-512 for stronger security.


      ``` javascript

      // v5 (SHA3-512, note the new timestamp field)

      const hash =
      SHA3512(apiKey|userName|password|mode|paymentAmount|merchantUniquePaymentId|timestamp)

       ```

      ---


      ## 4\. New and Changed Required Parameters


      | Parameter | v3 | v4 | v5 (required) |

      | --- | --- | --- | --- |

      | merchantCode | No | No | Yes |

      | customerEmail | No | Yes | Yes |

      | timestamp | No | No | Yes |


      **Details:**


      - `merchantCode`: Now required in both the payload and endpoint URL.
          
      - `customerEmail`: Added in v4, required in v5.
          
      - `timestamp`: New in v5, must be included in both the fingerprint and
      payload.
          
          - Format: `'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'` (UTC ISO-8601).
              

      > **❗Please note that if you or your merchants are expecting payment
      success confirmation emails, you must now explicitly pass**
      sendConfirmationEmailToMerchant **as true when calling the plugin to
      continue receiving these emails after the v5 migration.** 
        

      ---


      ## 5\. Example Migration: Before and After


      > **❗Please note that these examples are for demonstration purposes only.
      In production, always use a secure backend to generate fingerprints and
      handle sensitive data.** 
        
      > 🛡️ **Important**:  

      Always use the exact same values for all fingerprint parameters (apiKey,
      merchantCode, mode, paymentAmount, merchantUniquePaymentId, and especially
      **timestamp**) in both fingerprint payload and the ZenPay plugin
      payload.  

      Even a 1-second difference in timestamp will cause a fingerprint mismatch
      and throw an error during initialization (e.g., error **E08**). 
        

      ## v1 & v2:


      If you are on older versions of the plugin, please review the example
      below, or reach out to our integration team with any questions by emailing
      [integrations@zenithpayments.com.au
      ](https://mailto:integrations@zenithpayments.com.au) for assistance.


      ## v3 Example:


      ``` javascript

      // Create payload for fingerprint

      const apiKey = "PUBLIC_API_KEY";  // Provided by Zenith Payments

      const userName = "username";      // Provided by Zenith Payments

      const password = "password";      // Provided by Zenith Payments

      const mode = 0;                   // Mode 0: Static Payment - Mode 1:
      Tokenization - Mode 2: Dynamic Payment - Mode 3: Pre-auth

      const paymentAmount = 250.00;     // Tip: always use two decimal digits
      (e.g., 250.00)

      const merchantUniquePaymentId = crypto.randomUUID(); // Could be anything
      as long as unique

      // Generate fingerprint using SHA1

      const fpPayload =
      `${apiKey}|${userName}|${password}|${mode}|${paymentAmount *
      100}|${merchantUniquePaymentId}`;

      const fingerprint = CryptoJS.SHA1(fpPayload).toString(); 

      // Create payload for ZenPay plugin

      const zpPayload = {
        url: "https://payuat.travelpay.com.au/online/v3",
        apiKey,                         // Must match value used in fingerprint generation
        fingerprint,                    // SHA1 fingerprint
        redirectUrl: "https://payuat.travelpay.com.au/demo?result",
        mode,                           // Must match value used in fingerprint generation
        customerName: "Jane Doe",
        customerReference: "INV-991",
        merchantUniquePaymentId,        // Must match value used in fingerprint generation
          paymentAmount // Must match value used in fingerprint generation, but as dollars (e.g., if hash used 1234 then paymentAmount is 12.34)
      };

      // Initialize ZenPay plugin

      const payment = $.zpPayment({ ...zpPayload });

      const result = payment.open();    // Use open() for v3

       ```

      ---


      ## v5 Example:


      ``` javascript

      // Create payload for fingerprint

      const apiKey = "PUBLIC_API_KEY";            // Provided by Zenith Payments

      const userName = "username";                // Provided by Zenith Payments

      const password = "password";                // Provided by Zenith Payments

      const merchantCode = "TPDEMOMERCH";         // Provided by Zenith Payments
      - Required in v5

      const mode = 0;                             // Mode 0: Static Payment -
      Mode 1: Tokenization - Mode 2: Dynamic Payment - Mode 3: Pre-auth

      const paymentAmount = 250.00;               // Tip: always use two decimal
      digits (e.g., 250.00)

      const merchantUniquePaymentId = crypto.randomUUID(); // Could be anything
      as long as unique

      const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19); // Format:
      'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'

      // Generate fingerprint using SHA3-512

      const fpPayload =
      `${apiKey}|${userName}|${password}|${mode}|${paymentAmount *
      100}|${merchantUniquePaymentId}|${timestamp}`;

      const fingerprint = sha3_512(fpPayload); 

      // Create payload for ZenPay plugin

      const zpPayload = {
        url: "https://pay.sandbox.travelpay.com.au/online/v5",
        apiKey,                         // Must match value used in fingerprint generation
        fingerprint,                    // SHA3-512 fingerprint
        merchantCode,                   // Provided by Zenith Payments - Required in v5
        redirectUrl: "https://pay.sandbox.travelpay.com.au/demo?result",
        mode,                           // Must match value used in fingerprint generation
        customerName: "Jane Doe",
        customerReference: "INV-991",
        merchantUniquePaymentId,        // Must match value used in fingerprint generation
        paymentAmount,                  // Must match value used in fingerprint generation, but as dollars (e.g., if hash used 1234 then paymentAmount is 12.34)
        timestamp,                      // Must match value used in fingerprint generation
        customerEmail: "jane.doe@example.com"
      };

      // Initialize ZenPay plugin

      const payment = $.zpPayment({ ...zpPayload });

      const result = payment.init();    // Use init() for v5

       ```

      ---


      ## 6\. One-Time IDs


      - **`merchantUniquePaymentId`** must be unique for every payment request.
          
      - Once used, it cannot be reused, regardless of payment status.
          

      ---


      ## 7\. Summary Table: Key Migration Changes


      | Change | v3 | v5 (required) |

      | --- | --- | --- |

      | Hash Algorithm | SHA1 | SHA3-512 |

      | Fingerprint Fields | No timestamp | Includes `timestamp` |

      | merchantCode | Not required | Required |

      | customerEmail | Not required | Required (since v4) |

      | timestamp | Not required | Required |


      ---


      ## 8\. Best Practices


      - **Never** generate fingerprints or handle backend secrets client-side.
          
      - Always generate the fingerprint and unique payment ID on your backend.
          
      - Validate all required fields before initializing the plugin.

      Please note that to provide a consistent and more stable integration
      testing environment, we are transitioning all integration activities from
      the current UAT environment to a dedicated Sandbox environment for all our
      integration partners.


      Effective from Tuesday 27th May, 2025 at 9:00 PM AEST the new testing
      environment will be accessible at:
      [https://pay.sandbox.[ProgramDomain].com.au](https://pay.sandbox.[ProgramDomain].com.au)


      - There will be no change to your API keys as part of this migration
          
      - Please prepare your development cycle around this date, as we will no
      longer support the current UAT environment from the above stated date.

      The jQuery Plugin solution now supports Apple Pay. To set it up, the
      Zenith Payments team can guide you through the integration process
      consisting of a few simple steps.


      ## Integration Process


      To accept Apple Pay payments using the jQuery plugin, you need to follow a
      few simple steps:


      1. The integrator or merchant needs to contact the Zenith Payments
      Integrations Team with the specific domain URL that they would like to
      integrate with Apple Pay (e.g.,
      [www.b2bpay.com.au](http://www.b2bpay.com.au))
          
      2. Zenith Payments will register the provided domain with Apple Pay. (This
      is a crucial step to ensure the security and proper functioning of the
      integration).
          
      3. After the domain is registered, Zenith Payments will provide a file for
      each domain/merchant. This file is essential for the integration process.
          
      4. The integrator/merchant must place the provided file in a specific path
      on their website, ensuring it is publicly accessible. This step is
      essential for Apple Pay to verify the integration.
          
      5. Once the file is in place, reach out to the team at Zenith Payments and
      the team will verify the integration with Apple Pay.
          
      6. After successful verification, the integration is complete and Apple
      Pay is ready for use on the website using the jQuery payment plugin.

  - name: PayID
  - name: PayID > Overview
    description: >-
      PayID is a faster payment method for bank account payments.


      Customers can make PayID payments from within their bank account
      application or online banking portal by using a unique PayID identifier.
      Customers then enter the PayID (which is an email address) and a PayID
      description to make a payment to the merchant.


      PayID is a great alternative to EFT as merchants gain extra security by
      not having to provide their BSB and Bank Account details.


      #### Benefits to Merchants


      - Quick and easy new way to pay.

      - Instant approval with no subsequent failures.

      - Secure – no need to give out bank details (like with EFT) which prevent
      frauds and unauthorised debits

      - Cleared Funds in your bank account by lunchtime the next banking day.

      - Always the correct reference regardless of what the customer enters
      \*with ‘Customer’ PayID Type\*

      - Fast – easy to use, real time payment processing.

      - Easy – Customer pays via their existing bank APP / website.

      - Visible – payments immediately appear in the payment history.

      - Always On – operates 24/7 365.
          

      #### Benefits to Customers


      - Easy – pay through your existing Bank App/website

      - No cost to you

      - Merchant knows you have paid immediately

      - Merchant gets your transaction funds quickly

      - Secure, modern, payment method
          

      Zenith Payments supports three different types of PayID levels. More
      details about each of the different PayID types can be found below.


      **Summary of PayID Types**


      |  | **Program PayID** | **Customer PayID** | **Merchant PayID** |

      | --- | --- | --- | --- |

      | **PayID Type**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>**Example:**  <br> | Every
      merchant in the program has the same PayID email address.  <br> 
      <br>pay@travelpay.com.au  <br> | Every customer in the program has a
      unique PayID email address.  <br>  <br>john_12345678@travelpay.com.au |
      Every merchant in the program has a different PayID email address.  <br> 
      <br>@travelpay.com.au  <br> |

      | **Suitable For** | Most merchants wanting to quickly implement PayID. |
      Ongoing payments when customers may be inclined to enter the wrong
      reference when they pay. | One-off transactions / invoice payments  <br> |

      | **Customer profile and CML Required?  <br>(Customer-Merchant Link)** 
      <br> | Yes | Yes | No |

      | **PayID Description the customer needs to enter** | PayID Description
      the customer needs to enter | The customer can enter whatever reference
      they like. | Reference that was provided by the merchant on the invoice,
      etc.  <br> |

      | **Customer Reference used in reports (Reconciliation, etc.)** | The
      Customer Reference that is stored in the Customer’s profile for that
      merchant.  <br> | The Customer Reference that is stored in the Customer’s
      profile for that merchant. | 'Description/Message’ field the Customer
      enters in their Bank App/Site when paying |

      | **Additional Reference  <br>used in reports**  <br> |
      ‘Description/Message’ field the Customer enters in their Bank App/Site
      when paying | ‘Description/Message’ field the Customer enters in their
      Bank App/Site when paying | ‘Reference’ field the Customer enters in their
      Bank App/Site when paying |

      | **Advantages  <br>** | Easy to implement.  <br>  <br> | The merchant
      always receives the stored Customer Reference even if the customer enters
      the wrong reference when paying. | Easy to use – customer pays just like
      they would with EFT.  <br>  <br>Easy to implement – merchant just adds
      their PayID to their invoice template. |


      ## Merchant Level


      Merchant Level PayID provides the merchant with a unique PayID email
      address that they can put on their invoices or send to customers so that
      their customers can use to make a payment to that merchant.


      #### Use Cases


      - One-off transactions

      - Ad hoc Invoice payments
          

      #### How it Works?


      - PayID email address specifies the merchant in ZenPay. (i.e.
      (merchantcode)@b2bpay.com.au)

      - Does not require a customer profile to work (No CML is required)

      - The PayID reference is generated upon creation and is provided by the
      merchant

      - Customer enters in the correct reference as specified by the merchant to
      assist the merchant with reconciliation)
          

      #### How does a Merchant create a PayID Email Address?


      For this type of integration, PayID is created by the Zenith Support staff
      for the requested merchant/s.


      #### How does a customer make a PayID payment?


      The user makes a payment from their banking app via their mobile device or
      PC. User enters the PayID email, in return the banking app will display
      the PayID name for the merchant.


      The user enters description and message (reference) which are captured and
      attached to payment. "CustomerReference" and "AdditionalReference"
      parameters are used for capturing this information.

  - name: API Overview > Error Codes
    description: >-
      ZenPay uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or
      failure of an API request.


      In general "status codes" in the `2XX` range indicate success.


      Whereas, "status codes" in the `4XX` range indicate a client-side error,
      which means that there was a failure in the information provided (e.g., a
      missing parameter, unauthorized access etc.).


      "Status codes" in the `5XX` range indicate an error with Zenith Payment's
      internal servers (Which happens very rarely).


      If the response code is not `2XX`, it means the operation failed somehow
      and you may  

      need to take action accordingly. You can check the response (which will be
      in JSON format)  

      for a field called **`message`** which briefly explains the error
      reported.


      | Status Code | **Error** | Explanation |

      | --- | --- | --- |

      | 400 | Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a
      required parameter. |

      | 401 | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided. |

      | 402 | Request Failure | The request has failed, however the variables
      were valid. |

      | 403 | Forbidden | The API key does not have the the right permissions to
      perform the request. |

      | 404 | Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist. |

      | 429 | Too Many Requests | The API request limit is exceeded. Please see
      section Rate Limiting for more info. |

      | 5XX | Server Error | ZenPay servers have failed to process your request.
      (Rare, however you can contact support anytime). |
  - name: Webhooks and Callbacks
    description: >-
      Zenith Payments provides outbound notifications so that integrators can be
      informed of payment results.


      There are two technical delivery mechanisms:


      - **Webhooks** – Merchant-wide notifications configured once by Zenith.
      These are event-based: whenever a transaction belonging to the merchant
      changes status (across any channel or payment method), Zenith fires a
      webhook. They are dispatched on a scheduler/timer that evaluates
      transaction states and posts updates.
          
      - **Callbacks(jQuery Only)** – Transaction-specific notifications only
      available in the **jQuery Payment Plugin**. If the integrator includes a
      `callbackUrl` in the plugin payload, Zenith posts the transaction result
      to that URL after processing.
          

      **Key differences**


      | Aspect | Webhooks | Callbacks (jQuery plugin only) |

      | --- | --- | --- |

      | Scope | Merchant-wide (all transactions) | Single transaction (initiated
      by plugin) |

      | Trigger | Any payment status change | Immediately when upstream
      processing completes (response received) |

      | Configuration | Set up once by Zenith on merchant acct | Passed as
      `callbackUrl` in plugin payload |

      | Delivery | Event-based, timer-driven POST | Asynchronous POST after
      processing |

      | Availability | All channels / methods | jQuery plugin only, not APIs |


      > Use **Webhooks** for backend reconciliation and settlement tracking.  

      Use **Callbacks** if you need immediate, per-transaction acknowledgement
      when using the plugin. 
        

      # Webhooks


      Webhooks are merchant-wide, event-based notifications configured at the
      merchant account level by Zenith.


      Once a webhook endpoint is registered, Zenith will POST JSON payloads
      whenever the status of any transaction for that merchant changes. This
      includes all payment methods.


      **Requirements and Characteristics**


      - **Merchant-wide** – Any transaction initiated under the merchant account
      is eligible.
          
      - **Event-based** – Fired when transaction status changes (e.g. from
      Pending to Successful).
          
      - **Timer-driven** – A scheduled job evaluates transactions and dispatches
      events.
          
      - **Channel-agnostic** – All payment methods trigger the same webhook
      mechanism.
          
      - **Stable HTTPS POST endpoint** – Must be reachable from Zenith's
      servers.

      # Callbacks (jQuery Plugin Only)


      Callbacks are only supported in the **jQuery Payment Plugin** and are not
      available in the REST API.


      When a `callbackUrl` parameter is included in the plugin payload, Zenith
      will POST the transaction result to that URL after the payment is
      processed.


      **Requirements and Characteristics**


      - **Transaction-specific** – The callback applies only to the transaction
      in which the `callbackUrl` was supplied.
          
      - **Asynchronous** – Delivery occurs in the background after Zenith
      finishes processing, not as a browser redirect.
          
      - **Integrator-controlled** – The integrator decides the callback
      destination via the `callbackUrl` option.
          
      - **Not merchant-wide** – Callbacks do not notify on other transactions;
      for that, use webhooks.
          
      - **HTTPS POST endpoint** – Must expose a secure endpoint that is
      reachable from Zenith.
          
      - **Asynchronous handling** – Must accept POSTs that may arrive seconds
      after the browser flow completes.
          
      - **Validation** – Should validate the `validationCode` (SHA3-512) for
      integrity before trusting the payload.

      ## Basic Authentication


      [Basic
      authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
      is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client
      sends HTTP requests with the `Authorization` header that contains the word
      `Basic` followed by a space and a base64-encoded string
      `username:password`.


      ZenPay Merchant APIs utilize basic authentication alongside with API-Key
      for access. Please contact our integration team from
      [integrations@zenithpayments.com.au](https://mailto:integrations@zenithpayments.com.au)
      to request access for Merchant APIs.

        ### Important Notice for Using the Direct Card Payment Option:


        This endpoint allows the submission of raw card details (`cardNumber`,
        `expiryMonth`, `expiryYear`, `cvv`) for processing payments. **However,
        this method requires a certain level of PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry
        Data Security Standard) compliance** to ensure the secure handling of
        sensitive card information. To enhance security and reduce the risks
        associated with directly managing card data, we strongly recommend using
        our **Payment Plugin jQuery** for secure card tokenization and payment
        processing.


        **Please note:** This endpoint is restricted and can only be accessed
        once it has been enabled by Zenith Payments. Ensure you have the
        necessary permissions and configurations in place before attempting to
        use this method. For access or further assistance, please contact us at
        [integrations@zenithpayments.com.au](https://mailto:integrations@zenithpayments.com.au).
